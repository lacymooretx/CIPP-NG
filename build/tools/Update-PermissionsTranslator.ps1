.SYNOPSIS
Updates backend/Config/PermissionsTranslator.json from AzAdvertizer's published Entra ID API
permissions dataset.

.DESCRIPTION
PermissionsTranslator.json is a GUID -> scope-value lookup used by Add-CIPPDelegatedPermission.ps1:
the oauth2PermissionGrants API is granted string scope values (e.g. "Exchange.ManageV2"), not GUIDs,
so every required permission GUID is translated to its value through this file. A GUID that is missing
from the file is silently dropped from the grant - the permission never applies even though a manual
consent in the tenant resolves it fine.

The authoritative source spans many first-party resource apps (Microsoft Graph, Office 365 Exchange
Online, Partner Center, Defender, SharePoint, Teams, ...), which is why a Graph-only feed is not
enough. AzAdvertizer (https://www.azadvertizer.net, by Julian Hayward) publishes the full set as an
unauthenticated JSON file, so - like the license SKU data - this can be refreshed with no credentials.

Current-file GUIDs that are absent from the source (e.g. Partner Center user_impersonation) are
preserved, so a refresh only ever adds coverage; it never regresses an existing translation.

.EXAMPLE
Update-PermissionsTranslator.ps1

Downloads the latest permissions dataset and rewrites backend/Config/PermissionsTranslator.json.

.NOTES
Runs in CI via .github/workflows/update-permissions-translator.yml, which opens a PR when the file
changes. Keep this script cross-platform - CI runs it on Linux, and the file is written with LF
regardless of host so a Windows local run and the Linux CI run produce identical bytes.
