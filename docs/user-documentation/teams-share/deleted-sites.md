# Deleted Sites

This page lists the SharePoint sites that have been deleted in the selected tenant but are still recoverable from the tenant recycle bin, along with how long is left to recover each one. Microsoft keeps deleted sites for 93 days, after which the site and everything in it is permanently removed.
