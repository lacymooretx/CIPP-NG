# Teams

The Teams page lists every team in the selected tenant, with its name, description, and whether it is a public or private team. From here you can open a team's underlying Microsoft 365 group to edit it, or delete a team outright.

## Action Buttons

{% content-ref url="add.md" %}
[add.md](add.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Table Details

The properties returned are for the Graph resource type `group`, filtered to groups that have been Teams-enabled. For more information on the properties please see the [Graph documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-beta#properties).
