# Sharing Report

The SharePoint and OneDrive Sharing Report shows the sharing links and external shares across a single tenant's SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts, drawing attention to the riskiest ones: anonymous links, anonymous links that allow editing or never expire, and shares reaching external recipients. It requires a single tenant to be selected and is not available for All Tenants. The data is compiled from cached scans that you trigger and keep current from this page, and the report can be exported as a PDF.

## Syncing Sharing Data

The report reads from cached scans rather than querying SharePoint and OneDrive live. The first time you open it for a tenant there is no data yet, and a prompt invites you to run a scan. The controls at the top of the page build and refresh that data.

| Control       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sync data     | Queues scans of the tenant's SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts for sharing links, together with SharePoint and OneDrive usage data. Scanning every drive can take a while on large tenants, particularly the first time. Progress is shown next to the button, and the report refreshes itself once the scans finish. |
| Refresh       | The refresh icon reloads the report from the cached data without running a new scan. Use it when a scan has finished elsewhere, or when someone else has refreshed the cache.                                                                                                                |
| Export Report | Opens a preview of the report as a PDF, which you can then download. Greyed out until the report has data.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The time of the last completed scan is shown as "Last data refresh."

Results are written as the scan works through the tenant, so the report fills in site by site rather than staying empty until every drive has been read. Refreshing part-way through shows what has been scanned so far, and the totals settle once the scan finishes.

The first scan of a tenant reads every drive in full. Later syncs collect only what has changed since the previous one, so they finish considerably faster, and a full rescan is run periodically to catch anything a change-only pass would miss. A scan interrupted before it finishes, by a timeout on a large tenant for example, picks up where it stopped rather than starting the tenant over.

Sites that could not be read keep the links an earlier scan found for them rather than dropping out of the report, so those rows may be out of date. Links belonging to sites or libraries that no longer exist in the tenant are removed once the scan finishes.

## Summary

A row of headline counts sits above two cards that break the environment down further.

## Charts

Once a scan has data, the report charts the sharing links from several angles. The last two charts are added once usage data has been synced.
