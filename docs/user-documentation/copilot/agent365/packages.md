# Packages

This page lists the Microsoft Agent 365 agent packages registered in the selected tenant.

The list is read live from the tenant's package catalogue. Because the default catalogue listing omits agents, CIPP combines it with a second query for agent packages and merges the results into a single deduplicated view, so both agents and Microsoft 365 apps appear together.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Package Management API this page relies on requires a Microsoft Agent 365 licence on the tenant. Without one, the list will not populate.
