# Rooms

This page lists the room mailboxes in the selected tenant. Each row brings the mailbox together with the room's location and facility details, so the address, capacity, and building sit alongside the mailbox name. Rooms are grouped for users with [README.md](../room-lists/ "mention").

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Add Room Mailbox</summary>

Creates a new room mailbox in the selected tenant.

| Field                        | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display Name                 | The name shown in the address list and in booking dialogs. Required.                     |
| Username                     | The part before the @ symbol. Required.                                                  |
| Primary Domain name          | The domain used after the @ symbol, chosen from the tenant's verified domains. Required. |
| Resource Capacity (Optional) | The number of people the room seats. Left unset when the box is empty.                   |

**Create Room Mailbox** submits the form. Sign-in for the new mailbox is blocked as part of creating it, so nobody can sign in as the room. Once a mailbox has been created the button changes to **Create Another**, so the drawer can be reused without closing it. Everything else about the room, including its location, facilities, and booking behaviour, is set afterwards on the [edit.md](edit.md "mention") page.

## Table Details

Each row combines the room's mailbox with its location and facility details, so the columns below are not a straight return from a single Exchange command.

| Capacity                          | The number of people the room seats, taken from the room's location details and falling back to the capacity set on the mailbox. Shows `0` when neither has been set. |

| Hidden From Address Lists Enabled | `true` when the room is hidden from the global address list, so it does not appear in the room finder.                                                                |

**Please note:** Because newly created, updated, and converted rooms will not be shown via Graph immediately and can take up to 24 hours to be visible a decision was made to switch to the slower method of polling Exchange PowerShell.
