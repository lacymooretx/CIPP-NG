# Edit Room

Opened from **Edit Room** on the [README.md](./ "mention") page, this page covers everything about a single room: its name, how it handles bookings, when it is available, what facilities it has, and where it is. **Submit** applies every change on the page at once.

{% hint style="info" %}
A refresh button sits next to the **Basic Information** heading. It reloads the form with the room's current settings, which is worth doing after a change made elsewhere, for example in the Exchange admin center.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Emptying a text box does not clear the setting. The previous value stays in place, so a value such as a building or a phone number has to be removed from the Exchange admin center rather than from here.
{% endhint %}

| Maximum Booking Duration (Minutes) | The longest meeting the room accepts. Accepts 1 to 1440 minutes (24 hours).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Booking Process                    | How the room handles incoming invitations. `None - No processing` leaves requests for a delegate to answer, `AutoUpdate - Accept/Decline but not delete` records the request and leaves the message in the mailbox, and `AutoAccept - Accept and delete` books the meeting and removes the message. |
| Allow Recurring Meetings           | When on, the room accepts recurring meeting requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Allow Double-Booking               | When on, the room accepts requests that conflict with a meeting already booked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Process External Meetings          | When on, the room processes requests from senders outside the organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Enforce Room Capacity              | When on, the room declines meetings with more attendees than the capacity set above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Forward to Delegates               | When on, meeting requests are forwarded to the room's resource delegates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Delete Comments                    | When on, the body of the meeting request is removed from the copy kept on the room's calendar.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Remove Private Property            | When on, the private flag is cleared from bookings, so they are visible to anyone who can see the room's calendar.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Remove Canceled Meetings           | When on, cancelled meetings are removed from the room's calendar instead of being left in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

{% hint style="info" %}
Turning on **Add Organizer to Subject** while **Default Calendar Permission** is set to `Availability Only` or `None` raises a warning on the page. Those two permission levels hide the subject, so the organiser's name is added but nobody can read it. Set the permission to at least `Limited Details` for the name to be visible.
