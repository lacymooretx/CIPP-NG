# Edit Room List

Opened from **Edit Room List** on the [README.md](./ "mention") page, this page renames a room list, changes which rooms and owners it holds, and controls whether it accepts external mail. The heading reads **Room List:** followed by the list's display name, and **Submit** applies every change on the page at once.

A **View members** button sits beside the heading. It swaps the form for a read-only table of the list's current contents, with a **Type** column marking each row as `Owner` or `Room` alongside the user principal name and display name. The button changes to **Edit Membership** to switch back.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Emptying **Display Name**, **Description**, or **Mail Nickname** leaves the previous value in place. These cannot be cleared from this page.
{% endhint %}

**Room List Properties**

| Field         | Description                                                                                                  |

| Mail Nickname | The alias of the room list. Changing this also renames the room list object, so it is not a cosmetic change. |
