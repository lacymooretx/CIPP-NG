# Edit Equipment Mailbox

This page changes the details and booking behaviour of an equipment mailbox. It is reached from the **Edit Equipment** action on [README.md](README.md "mention"), and opens with the mailbox's current settings filled in.

**Basic Information**

| Field                      | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display Name               | The name the equipment is listed under in the address list. Required.                           |
| Hidden From Address Lists  | Keeps the equipment out of the address list, so it can still be booked directly but not browsed. |

**Booking Information**

| Field                             | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
