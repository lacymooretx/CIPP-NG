# Policies

A retention policy is the container that groups retention tags together and is then applied to a mailbox. A mailbox can have only one retention policy at a time, and the tags in that policy are the retention options its user sees in Outlook. This page lists the retention policies in the selected tenant, alongside [README.md](../tags/README.md "mention").

## Action Buttons

{% content-ref url="policy.md" %}
[policy.md](policy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Table Details

The properties returned are for the Exchange Online PowerShell command `Get-RetentionPolicy`. For more information on the command please see the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/get-retentionpolicy).
