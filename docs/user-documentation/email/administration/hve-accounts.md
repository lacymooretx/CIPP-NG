# HVE Accounts

High Volume Email (HVE) accounts are purpose-built Exchange Online accounts for sending bulk internal mail from apps and devices, such as invoices, alerts, and LOB notifications, without consuming a user licence or hitting standard mailbox throttling limits. Use this page to create an HVE account in the selected tenant and grab the SMTP settings needed to wire it into your application.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Add HVE User</summary>

Creates an HVE account in the selected tenant. The drawer also shows the SMTP settings the sending application needs: server `smtp.hve.mx.microsoft` (the older `smtp-hve.office365.com` is deprecated), port `587`, STARTTLS with TLS 1.2 or 1.3, authenticating with the account's own credentials or an OAuth token.

| Field                | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display Name         | The name the account is listed under. Required.                                               |
| Password             | The password the sending application authenticates with. Required, and at least 8 characters. |
| Primary SMTP Address | The full address the account sends as. Required, and validated as an email address.           |

**Create HVE User** submits the form. Once an account has been created the button changes to **Create Another User** and the form clears.

Creating an account also prepares the tenant for it. You are warned if Security Defaults are switched on, since HVE may not work while they are, and the new account is added to the exclusions of any Conditional Access policy that would otherwise block it from signing in. The results panel names each policy that was changed.
