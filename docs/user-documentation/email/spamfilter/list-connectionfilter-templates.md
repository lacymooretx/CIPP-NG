# Connection Filter Templates

This page lists the connection filter templates saved in CIPP. Templates hold the settings that the **Deploy ConnectionFilter** form applies to a tenant, and they are created either with the **Create template based on filter** action on [README.md](list-connectionfilter/README.md "mention") or by importing from a community repository.

## Table Details

The columns come from the saved template, so a column is empty where the template does not set that value.

| Column           | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name             | The template name, taken from the policy it was created from.                                              |
| Is Default       | Carried over from the policy the template was created from. It has no effect when the template is applied. |
| IP Allow List    | The IP addresses and ranges the template always allows through connection filtering.                       |
| IP Block List    | The IP addresses and ranges the template always blocks.                                                    |
| Enable Safe List | Whether the template turns on Microsoft's safe list of trusted senders.                                    |
| GUID             | The unique identifier CIPP assigns to the template.                                                        |
