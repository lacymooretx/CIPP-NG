# Quarantine Policies

This page lists the quarantine policies in the selected tenant and shows the tenant's global quarantine notification settings above the table. A quarantine policy controls what end users are allowed to do with their own quarantined messages, and it is referenced from the tenant's anti-spam, anti-phishing, anti-malware, and Safe Attachments policies.

## Global Quarantine Settings

The card above the table shows the settings that govern the quarantine notification message itself. These apply to the whole organisation rather than to any one policy. The refresh icon on the card reloads them without reloading the table.

| Custom Language        | The languages configured for custom notification text. Select it to open the Custom Language Settings flyout, which lists the sender display name, subject, and disclaimer held against each language. |

Where the settings cannot be read for the selected tenant, every item shows `n/a`.

Microsoft supplies a set of built-in policies alongside any you create yourself. The built-in ones cannot be changed or removed, and the **Custom Policies** and **Built-in Policies** presets tell the two apart.

**More Info** opens a flyout with **Id**, **Name**, the full end-user permissions, **Guid**, **Builtin**, **When Created**, and **When Changed**.
