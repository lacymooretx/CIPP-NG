# Spamfilter

This page lists the hosted content filter (anti-spam) policies in the selected tenant, together with the state and priority of the content filter rule that applies each one. Use it to see which policy is the tenant's default, which rules are live, and what each policy does with high confidence spam, bulk mail, and phishing.

**Rule State** and **Rule Prio** come from the rule that applies the policy, so both are empty on a policy that has no rule attached to it.

**More Info** opens a flyout showing the policy's advanced scoring and marking options, covering the score increases for image links, numeric IPs, redirects to another port, and business or info URLs, along with the marking options such as **Mark As Spam Bulk Mail**, **Mark As Spam Spf Record Hard Fail**, and **Mark As Spam Ndr Backscatter**.
