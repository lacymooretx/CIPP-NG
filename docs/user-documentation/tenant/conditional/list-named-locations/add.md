# Add Named Location

This page creates a Conditional Access named location. Unlike most pages in CIPP, it is not limited to the tenant selected in the menu bar: you choose the tenants explicitly, and the same named location is created in each of them. That makes it a quick way to roll a standard office IP range or country restriction out across your estate in one pass.

### IP Location

| Field                    | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IPs                      | The address ranges, one per line, in CIDR format, for example `111.111.111.111/24`. Required. |

{% hint style="info" %}
A named location is either country-based or IP-based, never both. If you need to combine the two in a policy, create separate named locations and reference them together in the policy's location condition.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Creating the same named location across several tenants gives you locations that share a name but are separate objects, each with its own identifier. Later edits are per tenant, so if the underlying ranges change you will need to update each one, either from the named locations list or by creating a replacement here.
