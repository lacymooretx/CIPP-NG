## **Understanding Standards**

This page is a reference to the features of the Standards Templates page in CIPP. To better understand Standards and Drift, please see the main page for ...
{% endhint %}

This page lists every Standards and Drift template you have built. A template is a named set of standards together with the tenants it applies to, and it is the unit CIPP schedules, runs, and reports against.

For a list of the standards you can configure inside a template, see [available-standards.md](available-standards.md "mention").

## Action Buttons

`Add Template` and `Create Drift Template` will open [template.md](../../template.md "mention") with the settings available for the respective template type.

<summary>Browse Catalog</summary>

Opens the policy catalogue, where you can import a prebuilt standards template rather than assembling one yourself.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are upgrading from a version of CIPP that predates templates, a **Convert Legacy Standards** prompt appears above the table whenever legacy standards are detected. Converting creates a new template for each standard you had, with the schedule disabled. Check each new template is correct before re-enabling its schedule.
