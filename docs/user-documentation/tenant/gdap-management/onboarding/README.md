# Onboarding

Onboarding tenants can be a challenge sometimes, especially when you haven't really taken care of your GDAP environments yet. CIPP handles the work for you: tenant onboarding automatically adds missing groups, adds missing users, and finishes everything off, removing all of the manual GDAP labour except accepting the invite.

This page lists previous and in-progress onboarding attempts, so you can see how far each one got and retry any that failed. Use the [start.md](start.md "mention") button to begin a new one.

## Table Details

| Column                                 | Description                                                                             |

| Timestamp                              | When the onboarding was last updated.                                                   |
| Relationship - Customer - Display Name | The customer tenant the onboarding relates to.                                          |

### Onboarding Steps

Each onboarding runs through the same five steps in order.

| Step                       | Description                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1: GDAP Invite        | Confirms the relationship has been approved by the customer and is active.             |
| Step 2: GDAP Role Test     | Checks the relationship contains the roles CIPP expects.                               |
| Step 3: GDAP Group Mapping | Assigns the relationship's roles to the mapped security groups in your partner tenant. |
| Step 4: CPV Refresh        | Refreshes the CIPP-SAM application's consent in the customer tenant.                   |
| Step 5: Graph API Test     | Confirms CIPP can successfully call Microsoft Graph against the tenant.                |

Onboarding also runs on a nightly schedule, so an approved invite is picked up automatically even if you never start the process by hand.
