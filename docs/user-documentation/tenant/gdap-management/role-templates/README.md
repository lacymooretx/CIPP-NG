# Role Templates

This page lists the GDAP role templates you have created. A template is a named set of role mappings, and it is what you select when generating an invite or onboarding a tenant, so that every relationship is built with a consistent set of permissions.

If this is your first time setting up CIPP, the page prompts you to create the **CIPP Defaults** template, which contains the 15 roles included on the [recommended-roles.md](../../../../setup/maintaining-cipp/recommended-roles.md "mention") page. The prompt appears whenever no template named `CIPP Defaults` exists, so it will return if you delete or rename that template.

Use the **Add Template** button to create a new template via [add.md](add.md "mention").
