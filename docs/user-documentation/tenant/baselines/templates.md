# Manage Baselines

Every baseline you have created or imported is listed here, with the standards it carries, the tenants it is assigned to, and how far each tenant has progressed through its stages. This is where baselines are added, edited, run on demand, shared, and removed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Baselines is in beta. Behaviour and screens are still changing between releases.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Add Baseline</summary>

Opens the [baseline editor](template.md) on a new, empty baseline.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Browse Catalog</summary>

Opens the baseline catalogue in a flyout, listing the ready-made baselines published in the community repositories you have connected. Importing one adds it to this list, where it can then be edited and assigned.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Migrate from Standards</summary>

Converts your classic Standards templates, drift templates included, into baselines. The originals are never modified, but while the Baselines feature is switched on the classic Standards and Drift pages and their scheduled runs stay turned off, so only one engine manages your tenants at a time.

The flyout previews every template it found and pre-selects the ones it can convert. Clear the tick against any you would rather leave behind, then use the **Migrate** button at the bottom.

| Import everything as report-only (recommended)                                                                             | Brings every standard across with automatic fixing switched off, so you can review the results before letting CIPP change anything. Re-enable it per standard afterwards. |
| Migrated drift templates should also alert on Intune and Conditional Access policies that were not created from a template | Adds detection of policies that exist in the tenant but were never deployed from a template, so they surface as deviations.                                               |

Each template in the list carries a status.

| Status      | Meaning                                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ready       | The template has not been migrated before and will be created as a baseline. |
| Will update | A baseline already exists for this template and will be brought up to date.  |
| Up to date  | An existing baseline already matches the template, so nothing is done.       |
| Skipped     | The template was not converted. The row explains why.                        |
| Migrated    | The template was created as a new baseline during this run.                  |
| Updated     | An existing baseline was brought up to date during this run.                 |
| Failed      | The conversion did not complete. The row explains why.                       |

Selecting a row opens the **Baseline Details** flyout. Alongside those values it shows the progress of each stage: how many tenants sit in it, how many standards it applies, the date of the next time-based advance, and the conditions a tenant must meet before it moves into the following stage.
