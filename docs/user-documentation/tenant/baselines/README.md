# Baselines

{% hint style="warning" %}
Baselines is a beta feature and is off by default. Turn it on with the **Baselines** flag on the [features.md](../../cipp/settings/features.md "mention") tab of CIPP settings. Behaviour and screens are still changing between releases.
{% endhint %}

A baseline is the desired configuration for your tenants. CIPP checks every assigned tenant against it twice a day, shows exactly what deviates, and, where you allow it, corrects the deviation automatically. Standards are grouped into stages so a baseline can roll out gradually, with each stage adding more of the configuration as a tenant graduates into it.

Baselines supersede the classic Standards and Drift pages. While the Baselines feature is switched on in [Features](../../cipp/settings/features.md), those pages and their scheduled runs are turned off, so only one engine manages your tenants at a time. Your existing Standards templates can be brought across with **Migrate from Standards** on the [Baselines](templates.md) page.

The Fleet Overview is the landing screen for the feature and summarises every tenant covered by a baseline. Use the tabs at the top to move between this overview, [Alignment](alignment.md), and the list of [Baselines](templates.md) themselves.

## First Run

Until you have created a baseline, the overview is replaced by a **Welcome to Baselines** card that explains the three steps needed to make the dashboard useful: create a baseline and add standards to it, assign the tenants or tenant groups it applies to, then save and run the first check. Nothing is changed in a tenant until you enable automatic fixing on an individual standard.

The card carries two buttons.

| Button                      | Description                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create your first baseline  | Opens the [baseline editor](template.md) on a new, empty baseline.                   |
| Browse the community catalog | Opens the list of [Baselines](templates.md), where ready-made baselines can be imported. |

## Score Bar

Four tiles across the top of the page summarise the whole fleet.

| Tile                                  | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compliant with accepted deviations    | The share of standards that count as aligned, including deviations you have accepted. The tooltip shows how much of the score comes from acceptances. |
| Compliant with baseline               | The share of standards genuinely in their expected state, with accepted deviations excluded.                                                      |
| Open Deviations                       | The number of deviations awaiting a decision. Selecting the tile opens Alignment filtered to those deviations.                                     |
| License Missing                       | The share of standards left out of scoring because the tenant is not licensed for them. Selecting the tile opens Alignment filtered to those rows. |

## Fleet Compliance Trend

Plots both compliance figures over the last 14 days, so you can see whether the estate is improving. Trend data appears after the first baseline has run.

## Deviation States

A breakdown of every applicable standard across the fleet by its current state: Compliant, Accepted, Drift, or Denied.

## Tenants Needing Attention

The five lowest-scoring tenants, each with a progress bar showing how closely it matches its baselines. Selecting a tenant switches to it and opens the [Alignment](alignment.md) page, ready for you to triage its deviations or produce a What-If Report.

## Accepted & Denied Deviations

Every deviation you have already ruled on, across all tenants.

| Column   | Description                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tenant   | The tenant the deviation was found in.                                  |
| Standard | The standard that deviates from its baseline.                           |
| Status   | Whether the deviation was accepted, or denied and queued for correction. |
| Reason   | The justification recorded when the decision was made.                  |
| Set By   | The operator who made the decision.                                     |
| Expires  | When an acceptance lapses, after which the deviation is raised again.   |
