# Baseline Alignment

This page shows how tenants measure up against the baselines assigned to them, and is where deviations are triaged. The same data is presented four ways, and you switch between them with the toggle above the table. Each view carries its own columns, filters, and actions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Baselines is in beta. Behaviour and screens are still changing between releases.

| View          | Use it to                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant View   | Work through every standard applicable to the tenant you have selected.          |
| Standard View | See how a single standard is faring across the whole estate.                     |
| Baseline View | See which tenants a baseline covers, and how far each has progressed its stages. |
| Historic View | Read every recorded run and operator decision for the selected tenant.           |

## Deviation States

Every row in the Tenant and Standard views carries a state.

| State                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compliant                  | The setting matches what the baseline expects.                                                                                                                                |
| Drift                      | The setting differs from the baseline and is awaiting a decision.                                                                                                             |
| Accepted                   | The deviation has been accepted, so the tenant counts as aligned until the acceptance expires.                                                                                |
| Partially Accepted         | Individual properties of the setting have been accepted, but others still deviate.                                                                                            |
| Denied - Remediate Pending | The deviation was denied, and the setting is corrected back to the baseline on the next run.                                                                                  |
| Denied - Delete Pending    | The deviation was denied, and the offending policy is removed on the next run.                                                                                                |
| Conflict                   | Two baselines configure the same standard at the same assignment level with different settings, so nothing is compared or corrected. Edit one of the baselines to resolve it. |
| Skipped - No License       | The tenant is not licensed for the standard, so it is left out of scoring.                                                                                                    |
| No Data                    | Nothing has been collected for the standard yet.                                                                                                                              |

## Tenant View

The view opens on the tenant currently selected, and is laid out as a score bar, the baselines assigned to that tenant, and the table of applicable standards.

### Score Bar

| Tile                               | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compliant with accepted deviations | The share of standards counting as aligned, including deviations you have accepted. The tooltip shows how much of the score comes from acceptances. |
| Compliant with baseline            | The share of standards genuinely in their expected state, with accepted deviations excluded.                                                        |
| Open Deviations                    | How many deviations are awaiting a decision.                                                                                                        |
| License Missing                    | The share of standards left out of scoring because the tenant is not licensed for them.                                                             |

### Assigned Baselines

One card per baseline assigned to the tenant, showing how closely the tenant matches the standards rolled out to it so far, which stage it is in, and what has to happen before it reaches the next one. Where the next stage needs manual approval the card is marked **Awaiting approval** and carries a **Move to next stage** button, which applies that stage's standards on the following run.

### What-If Report

Produces a client-ready report previewing what the configured standards would change for the tenant, including the stages still to come. The preview opens in a dialog and can be downloaded as a PDF.

| Option                        | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branding                      | The branding preset the report is styled with. Presets are managed in Settings, under Branding.                        |
| Simulate additional baselines | Adds baselines the tenant is not assigned to, so everything they would bring appears in the report as planned changes. |
| What Is Already In Place      | Includes the policies already deployed and the settings already enforced, with their values.                           |
| Rollout Stages                | Includes how the remaining stages arrive and when.                                                                     |

**What Is Already In Place** and **Rollout Stages** each switch their section of the report on and off. Changes are reflected in the preview as you make them.

While a run is in progress a tracker appears next to the view toggle, showing its progress.

### Filters

| Filter          | Shows                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open Deviations | Standards that deviate from the baseline and have not yet been ruled on.  |
| Accepted        | Standards whose deviation has been accepted.                              |
| Denied          | Standards whose deviation was denied and which are queued for correction. |
| License Missing | Standards excluded from scoring because the tenant is not licensed.       |

| Stage         | The stage of its baseline the standard belongs to.                                             |
| Status        | The current deviation state, as listed above.                                                  |
| Reason        | The justification recorded when the deviation was accepted or denied.                          |
| Set By        | The operator who made that decision.                                                           |

| Expires       | When an acceptance lapses, after which the deviation is raised again.                          |
| Configured By | The baseline whose settings are in force for this tenant, or Tenant Override where one is set. |
| Last Run      | When the standard was last checked.                                                            |

Selecting a row opens the **Standard Details** flyout. It lists every baseline configuring the standard for this tenant and marks which one is effective, as the most specific assignment wins, and shows whether each one fixes drift automatically and whether it raises alerts.

Below that, the expected and current configurations are compared property by property, with each deviating property marked. An individual property can be accepted on its own, which tolerates only that value and still raises a deviation if anything else changes. Where the standard detects policies that no baseline covers, the offending policy can be opened and read in full, and can be denied and queued for deletion. The flyout also carries any manual task instructions, and the most recent runs for the standard, each of which can be expanded to show exactly what was expected and what was found.

Selecting a row opens the **Standard Tenant Summary** flyout, which adds the Secure Score points the standard is worth, a compliance trend once there is more than one day of data, and a card per tenant giving its state. Deviating tenants can be accepted or given a tenant override directly from those cards.

## Historic View

A timeline of everything recorded for the selected tenant: scheduled and manual runs, and the decisions operators have made. Runs are collapsed into a single entry carrying a count per outcome, which expands to the individual standards. Entries where an alert was sent are marked, and each run can be opened to show its logs.

The timeline can be narrowed by standard, outcome, and run type, or searched, and loads in blocks of fifty entries.

| Outcome                      | Meaning                                                          |
