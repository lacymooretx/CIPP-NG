# Secure Score

The Tenant Overview presents Microsoft Secure Score. With a single tenant selected it shows that tenant's current standing and every recommendation Microsoft makes for it, one card per recommendation, ordered by completion with the most complete first. With All Tenants selected it shows an estate-wide summary instead. The same data is available as a table on table.md.

## All Tenants View

Selecting All Tenants replaces the cards with a portfolio view, built from CIPP's nightly score cache rather than live calls to Microsoft. Four figures run across the top.

| Tile               | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Portfolio average  | The average of every tenant's latest cached score. Hover to see how many tenants it covers.                                   |
| Change over N days | How far the portfolio average has moved across the retained history, in points. The heading names the number of days covered. |
| Highest            | The best scoring tenant's percentage. Hover to see which tenant it is and its score in points.                                |
| Lowest             | The lowest scoring tenant's percentage, with the same detail on hover.                                                        |

**Portfolio trend** charts the daily average across the retained history. Each day is averaged only over the tenants that reported a score that day, so a tenant that started reporting part way through the window does not drag the earlier points down.

**Top 5** and **Bottom 5** rank the estate by score, with a coloured bar per tenant: green at 75% or above, amber from 50%, red below that. Selecting a tenant opens its own Secure Score page and switches the tenant selector to it. Ranks are estate-wide, so #1 is the best scoring tenant in the estate rather than the best of five. The two boards never overlap: Bottom 5 takes the lowest five and Top 5 takes whatever remains, so an estate with fewer than ten scored tenants shows a shorter Top 5.

{% hint style="info" %}
Scores appear only after the nightly cache job has run, so a newly added tenant shows nothing until the next refresh. Tenants with no maximum score recorded are left out of the average and the leaderboards entirely.
{% endhint %}

The filters, cards and actions described below apply to the single-tenant view.

## Score Summary

Four figures run across the top of the page.

| Tile                             | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current Score                    | The tenant's current score as a percentage of the maximum score available to it.    |
| Compared score (All Tenants)     | The average score Microsoft reports across all tenants, for comparison.             |
| Compared score (Similar Tenants) | The average score Microsoft reports for tenants of a comparable size.               |
| Score in points                  | The current score and the maximum available, in points rather than as a percentage. |

Below them, the **Secure Score** card charts the last seven score readings Microsoft has recorded for the tenant, each labelled by how long ago it was taken, so recent movement is visible at a glance.

## Filters

The filter button above the cards limits which recommendations are shown. The current selection is shown on the button itself.

| Filter                | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All Recommendations   | Shows every recommendation regardless of status.                                    |
| Completed (100%)      | Shows only recommendations that are fully complete.                                 |
| Not Started (0%)      | Shows only recommendations with no progress at all.                                 |
| In Progress (Started) | Shows recommendations that are partially complete, meaning anything from 1% to 99%. |

## Recommendation Cards

Each card covers one recommendation and carries the following, where Microsoft supplies it:

* A chip showing how complete the recommendation is, coloured green at 100%, amber above 50%, and red at 50% or below. A recommendation marked as handled elsewhere also reads "Resolved by Third Party".
* **Description**, explaining what the recommendation covers.
* **Remediation Recommendation**, explaining how to satisfy it. Where a CIPP standard covers the recommendation, this points to that standard instead of Microsoft's own instructions. It is hidden once the recommendation reaches 100%.
* **Threats**, the threat categories the recommendation mitigates.
* **Compliance Frameworks**, the certifications and controls the recommendation maps to.

## Card Actions

| Action        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Change Status | Records how the recommendation has been handled, choosing a resolution type and a reason. Unavailable, and shown greyed out, for Microsoft Defender controls.                                                                       |
| Remediate     | Opens the Microsoft portal page for the recommendation in a new tab. Where a CIPP standard covers the recommendation, it opens standards instead.                                                                                   |
| Updates       | Lists the status changes recorded against the recommendation, showing the state set, who it was assigned to, the reason given, who made the change and when. Only shown where changes exist, with the number of them on the button. |

### Resolution types

**Change Status** offers three resolutions, along with a reason that is stored as the comment against the control and is visible in the Microsoft portal as well as in CIPP.

| Resolution type         | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resolved by Third Party | The recommendation is satisfied by a product outside Microsoft 365. Marks it complete and awards the points.                                               |
| Ignored / Risk Accepted | The recommendation is not going to be actioned. Marks it complete without awarding the points.                                                             |
| Mark as default         | Hands the recommendation back to Microsoft's own detection, awarding points only when Microsoft sees it as complete. Use this to undo either of the above. |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Marking a recommendation as resolved by a third party or as risk accepted changes the tenant's score in Microsoft's own reporting, not just in CIPP. Record a reason that will still make sense to whoever reads it months later, since it is the only record of why the score was adjusted.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Defender controls cannot be updated from here at all. Microsoft only accepts status changes for those through the Microsoft Defender portal, so **Change Status** is disabled on those cards and the API rejects the change if it is attempted another way.
