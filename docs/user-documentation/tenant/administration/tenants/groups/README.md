# Tenant Groups

Lists your custom tenant groups and gives you the tools to create and maintain them. Tenant groups are logical groupings of managed tenants that can be selected anywhere CIPP asks for a tenant filter, which saves you picking the same set of tenants by hand every time. A group is either static, where you choose its members explicitly, or dynamic, where CIPP evaluates a set of rules against your tenants and works out the membership for you.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Add Tenant Group</summary>

Opens a flyout to create a new tenant group. Set the group name, description, and group type, then either pick the initial member tenants for a static group or build the membership rules for a dynamic group. Dynamic groups also offer the option to exclude the partner tenant from the group even when the membership rules would otherwise include it. The fields are the same as those on the edit page, so see edit.md for the full detail on configuring a group.

<details>

<summary>Show Usage / Hide Usage</summary>

Toggles the Usage column in the table. Leaving it off keeps the page quicker to load, since working out usage means reading through your templates, tasks, rules, roles, and mappings. See the Usage entry under Table Details for what it reports.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Create Default Groups</summary>

Creates a predefined set of dynamic tenant groups provided by CIPP, intended as ready made starting points for standards templates. Any group whose name already exists is skipped rather than overwritten, so it is safe to run more than once. You are asked to confirm before the groups are created.

| Name                                      | What it matches                                                                                                                 |

| All Tenants (Excluding Partner)           | Every tenant managed through a GDAP or direct relationship, with the partner tenant itself excluded.                            |

Opens a flyout showing CIPP's own log entries for tenant group activity, covering things like dynamic rule runs, group creation, and any failures encountered while processing them.

| Column      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name        | The name of the group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Description | The description set for the group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Group Type  | Whether the group is `static`, with membership you set explicitly, or `dynamic`, with membership evaluated from rules.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Members     | The tenants currently in the group. For a dynamic group this reflects the last rule evaluation rather than a live check.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Usage       | Where the group is currently referenced elsewhere in CIPP, naming each item and how it is used. Covers standards templates, scheduled tasks, alert rules, custom roles, custom data mappings, and the rules of other dynamic groups. Only shown when Show Usage is toggled on. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Check the Usage column before deleting a group. A group that is still referenced by a standards template or a custom role will leave that reference pointing at nothing once removed.
