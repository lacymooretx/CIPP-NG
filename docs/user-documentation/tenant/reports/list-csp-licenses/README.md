# Sherweb Licence Report

This report lists the CSP subscriptions Sherweb holds for the selected tenant, showing each product's SKU, purchase date, quantity, and renewal date. From here you can adjust licence counts up or down, schedule a reduction to take effect at the next renewal, or cancel a subscription outright.

Unlike the [list-licenses.md](../list-licenses.md "mention"), which reads licence data from the tenant itself, this page queries Sherweb's billing API directly. It therefore shows what you are being billed for rather than what is assigned in Microsoft 365, and the two will not always agree.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page requires the Sherweb integration to be enabled, and the tenant to be mapped to a Sherweb customer in the integration settings. Where either is missing, the page reports that it cannot retrieve CSP licences rather than returning an empty table.

{% hint style="danger" %}
These actions change what you are billed for and take effect against Sherweb immediately. There is no confirmation step beyond the prompt, and increases are purchases. Check the tenant's actual assignment counts on the list-licenses.md before reducing a subscription, since Sherweb does not know which licences are assigned in Microsoft 365.
