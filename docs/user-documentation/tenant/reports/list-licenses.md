# Licence Report

This report lists every licence SKU present in the selected tenant, showing how many of each are owned, how many are in use, and who holds them. It is the quickest way to spot over-provisioning across a client base, or to find which users and groups are consuming a particular SKU.

The report supports the All Tenants view. Because gathering licence data from every tenant takes time, the first request queues a background job and shows a message asking you to check back once it completes. Results are cached for an hour, so subsequent loads return immediately.

{% hint style="info" %}
SKUs configured as excluded in CIPP's licence settings are omitted from the report.

### Term Info

A SKU can be backed by more than one subscription, so Term Info holds an entry per subscription.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This report tries to make an estimate of the NCE term by calculating the dates. As this is an estimate, these dates might not be accurate and require manual checking in your CSP's own environment.
