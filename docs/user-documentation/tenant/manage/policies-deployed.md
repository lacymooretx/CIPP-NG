# Policies and Settings Deployed

This page shows what a single standards template contains and how each item currently stands against the selected tenant. It is a read-only view built by comparing the template's contents with the tenant's live configuration, broken into Security Standards, Intune Policies and Conditional Access Policies.

Two things determine what is shown: the template chosen in the **Template** picker at the top of the page, and the tenant currently selected in CIPP. Each section header carries a count of the items in it, and sections can be collapsed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Until a template is selected, all three sections are empty. Arriving from a standards template carries the selection through, otherwise choose one from the **Template** picker.
{% endhint %}

## Status Values

The Status column in each section describes how the item stands against the tenant at the time of the last comparison.

| Status                | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deployed              | The tenant matches the template, either because the comparison reports the item as compliant or because the expected and current values are identical. |
| Not Deployed          | The comparison reports the item as not applied to the tenant.                                                                                          |
| Deviation - New       | A difference has been found that has not yet been reviewed.                                                                                            |
| Deviation - \<status> | A difference recorded against the tenant, shown with its current review status. Deviations are reviewed on drift.md.                                   |
| Not Configured        | No comparison data exists for the item, usually because the template has not yet run against this tenant.                                              |
