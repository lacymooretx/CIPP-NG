# MDE Onboarding

The state of the connector between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Intune, which is what lets Defender feed device risk into compliance and app protection. Use it to confirm the connector is actually live in a tenant before relying on any of the Defender driven policies built on top of it.

The page shows one of two views depending on your tenant selection. On a single tenant you get the connector's status in detail. On All Tenants you get a table comparing every tenant at once.

## Action Buttons

<summary>Sync</summary>

Queues a refresh of the onboarding status behind the page and tracks the job's progress. Available in both views.

## Single Tenant View

The connector's **Status** is shown as a chip at the top, along with the connector's last heartbeat and when CIPP last collected the data. Where the connector is not yet working, a **Start Onboarding** button takes you straight to the endpoint onboarding page in the Microsoft Defender portal for that tenant.

Below that, three cards break the connector's configuration down.
