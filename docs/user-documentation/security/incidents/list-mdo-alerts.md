# MDO Alerts

Alerts raised by Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in the selected tenant, narrowed to that product so mail and collaboration threats are not buried among endpoint and identity alerts. Take an alert, move it through its statuses, and open it in the Defender portal when you need the full picture.

## Table Details

The properties returned are for the Graph resource type `alert`, filtered to `serviceSource eq 'microsoftDefenderForOffice365'`. For more information on the properties please see the [Graph documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alert?view=graph-rest-beta#properties).

The Extended Info flyout goes considerably further than the table, adding the alert description and recommended actions, the evidence and affected resources behind it, the MITRE techniques matched, any named threat or actor, the detection source, and the first and last activity times.

{% hint style="info" %}
Selecting All Tenants queues a background job that collects alerts from every tenant, and the page tells you it is still loading. Come back in a few minutes for a complete list.
{% endhint %}
