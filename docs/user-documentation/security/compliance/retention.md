# Purview Retention Policies

Microsoft Purview retention policies control how long content is kept and what happens when that period ends. A policy sets the scope of workloads it applies to, and the retention rules attached to it carry the duration and the end of period action. This page lists the retention policies in the selected tenant, shows how many rules each one carries, and lets you enable, disable, delete or capture them as reusable templates.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Deploy Retention Policy</summary>

Opens a drawer that creates a retention policy in one or more tenants from a template or from parameters you supply yourself.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Select Tenants | The tenants to create the policy in. At least one is required, and you can pick several to deploy the same policy across a group of customers in one go. |
| Select a template (optional) | Picks a saved retention policy template. Choosing one fills **Parameters (JSON)** with that template's stored settings, which you can then edit before deploying. |
| Parameters (JSON) | The policy settings as JSON. Required. A worked example is shown in the field until you type into it, covering the policy name, workload locations and a nested `RuleParams` block holding the retention duration and action. |

## Table Details

| Column | Description |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                   | The policy name.                                                                                        |
| Enabled                | Whether the policy is currently switched on.                                                            |
| Workload               | The Microsoft 365 workloads the policy covers, such as Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive or Teams.          |
| Rule Count             | How many retention rules belong to this policy. Counted by CIPP, so a policy with no rules shows zero.   |
| Restrictive Retention  | Whether Preservation Lock is set on the policy.                                                          |
| Created By             | The account that created the policy.                                                                    |
| When Created UTC       | When the policy was created, in UTC.                                                                    |
| When Changed UTC       | When the policy was last modified, in UTC.                                                              |

{% hint style="danger" %}
Preservation Lock cannot be undone. Once it is set on a policy, nobody, including a Global Administrator, can disable or delete that policy, remove locations from it, or shorten its retention period. Locations can still be added and the retention period extended, but nothing can be taken back. **Disable Policy** and **Delete Policy** will fail against a locked policy.

Microsoft does not offer this setting in the Purview portal at all, specifically to guard against it being applied by accident. In CIPP it is reachable through the deploy drawer, and a template carrying it applies it to every tenant you deploy to without a confirmation step. Check what a template sets before deploying it. See [Preservation Lock](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention-preservation-lock) for Microsoft's guidance.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Microsoft returns the individual location lists on a retention policy empty, with the real scope carried in **Workload** instead. Read **Workload** to see what a policy covers, rather than the per workload location fields in the Extended Info flyout. Saving the policy as a template rebuilds the locations from **Workload**, so templates stay deployable.
