# Retention Policy Templates

Retention policy templates are saved retention configurations held in CIPP rather than in a tenant, so a policy you have settled on can be deployed to any number of customers without rebuilding it each time. Templates get here in three ways: capture one from a live policy with **Create template based on policy** on the Purview Retention Policies page, author one from JSON in the deploy drawer, or import one from a community repository.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Deploy Retention Policy</summary>

Opens a drawer that creates a retention policy in one or more tenants from a template or from parameters you supply yourself.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Select Tenants | The tenants to create the policy in. At least one is required, and you can pick several to deploy the same policy across a group of customers in one go. |
| Select a template (optional) | Picks a saved retention policy template. Choosing one fills **Parameters (JSON)** with that template's stored settings, which you can then edit before deploying. |
| Parameters (JSON) | The policy settings as JSON. Required. A worked example is shown in the field until you type into it, covering the policy name, workload locations and a nested `RuleParams` block holding the retention duration and action. |

</details>

<details>

<summary>Browse Catalog</summary>

Opens a drawer listing the retention policy templates published in the community repositories you have configured, so you can bring one into CIPP.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Search Templates | Narrows the list by template name, category or repository. |
| Repository | Restricts the list to chosen repositories. Shown once you have more than one repository configured. |
| Category | Restricts the list to chosen categories. Shown once the available templates span more than one category. |
| Card and list view | Switches between template cards and a compact list. |
| All, Not Imported, Imported, Updates | Filters by import state. **Updates** narrows to templates you already imported that have since changed upstream. |
| Select all | Selects every template currently listed, for importing in one go. |
| Force re-import | Imports a template again even when CIPP already holds it, overwriting the copy you have. |
| Import Selected | Imports everything you have ticked. |

Each template also carries its own **Preview** and **Import** buttons, and is chipped **Imported** or **Update Available** so you can see its state at a glance.

## Table Details

| Column | Description |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                  | The template name, taken from the policy it was captured from or the name in the JSON it was authored with. |
| Comments              | The description saved with the template.                                                                    |
| Enabled               | Whether the policy will be created switched on.                                                             |
| Restrictive Retention | Whether the policy will be created with Preservation Lock set.                                               |
| GUID                  | CIPP's identifier for the template. Quote it when raising a support request about a specific template.       |

{% hint style="danger" %}
A template with **Restrictive Retention** set applies Preservation Lock to every tenant you deploy it to, and the lock cannot be undone. Once it is set, nobody, including a Global Administrator, can disable or delete that policy, remove locations from it, or shorten its retention period.

Microsoft does not offer this setting in the Purview portal at all, specifically to guard against it being applied by accident, and deploying from here does not ask you to confirm. Check this column before deploying a template, and before saving one captured from a policy that already has the lock. See [Preservation Lock](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention-preservation-lock) for Microsoft's guidance.
