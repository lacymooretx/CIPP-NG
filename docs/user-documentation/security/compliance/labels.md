# Sensitivity Labels

Sensitivity labels classify content and carry protection with it. Once a label is applied to a file, an email or a container, it enforces whatever is configured on it: encryption, content marking such as headers, footers and watermarks, and site and group protection. Label policies then publish labels to users. This page lists the sensitivity labels in the selected tenant, shows which policies publish each one, and lets you recolour, delete or capture them as reusable templates.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Deploy Sensitivity Label</summary>

Opens a drawer that creates a sensitivity label in one or more tenants from a template or from parameters you supply yourself.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Select Tenants | The tenants to create the label in. At least one is required, and you can pick several to deploy the same label across a group of customers in one go. |
| Select a template (optional) | Picks a saved sensitivity label template. Choosing one fills **Parameters (JSON)** with that template's stored settings, and also loads the template's colour into **Label Color**. |
| Label Color (optional) | A colour picker for the label. It accepts any hex colour, where the Purview portal offers only its preset palette. A colour picked here overrides any colour set in the JSON below. Leave it empty to keep whatever the JSON specifies. |
| Parameters (JSON) | The label settings as JSON. Required. A worked example is shown in the field until you type into it, covering the display name, tooltip, content types, encryption settings, content marking and a nested `PolicyParams` block for the label policy that publishes it. |

The Extended Info flyout adds the label's comment, tooltip, parent label, footer marking setting, and **Published In Policies**, which CIPP works out by matching the label against the tenant's label policies so you can see where a label is actually surfaced to users.
