# Vulnerabilities

Software vulnerabilities found by Microsoft Defender across the selected tenant's onboarded devices, grouped so that each CVE appears once with a count of the devices it affects rather than once per device. Use it to see which vulnerabilities are worth chasing in a tenant and how far each one has spread.

## Table Details

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only **Affected Devices Count** and **Affected Devices** reflect every device behind a row. The remaining columns are taken from a single one of the grouped findings, so where a CVE spans more than one platform, vendor or software version, this table shows one of them rather than all of them. Treat those columns as an example of what the CVE was found on, not a complete picture.
