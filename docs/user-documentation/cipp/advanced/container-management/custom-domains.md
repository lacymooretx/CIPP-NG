# Custom Domains

{% hint style="info" %}
## CyberDrain Hosted Next Generation Migration

If you have recently migrated to CIPP's next-generation infrastructure, use the [management portal](https://management.cipp.app/) to re-add your custom domain. CIPP itself does not have the permissions required to move the domain from your old instance.
{% endhint %}

The Custom Domains page maps custom domains onto the Azure App Service that hosts this CIPP instance, so you can reach CIPP on your own hostname instead of the default `*.azurewebsites.net` address. Setting up a domain involves a DNS alias record, a hostname binding on the App Service, and an optional free managed TLS certificate. A wizard walks through all three and can be reopened at any time to finish or fix a domain. The default `*.azurewebsites.net` hostname always remains available.

## App Service Details

The App Service card shows the read-only details you need when creating DNS records for a custom domain.

| Field                  | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Site name              | The name of the App Service hosting this CIPP instance.                                                 |
| Default hostname       | The App Service's default hostname. Use this as the CNAME target when adding a subdomain.               |
| Inbound IP (A record)  | The App Service's inbound IP address. Use this as the A record value when adding an apex (root) domain. |

## Table Details

The Custom Domains table lists every hostname bound to the App Service. Selecting a row opens a details flyout showing the hostname, its SSL state, the binding type, and — where a certificate is present — its thumbprint and expiry date.

| Column   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hostname | The domain bound to the App Service.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Status   | The security state of the binding: Default (Azure-managed) for the built-in hostname, Secured (SNI SSL) or Secured (IP SSL) when a certificate is bound, or Not secured when no certificate is present. |

## Adding or Fixing a Domain

Select **Add Custom Domain** to start the wizard, or use **Manage / Fix** on an existing domain to resume where it left off. The wizard has three steps.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Configure DNS record

Enter the fully qualified domain CIPP should answer on. This can be a subdomain (for example `portal.contoso.com`), an apex domain (`contoso.com`), or a wildcard (`*.contoso.com`). The wizard then shows the DNS record to create at your DNS provider:

* An **Alias** record: a CNAME pointing to the App Service default hostname for a subdomain, or an A record pointing to the inbound IP for an apex domain.

Create the record, then select **Check DNS** to verify it. Once verified you can continue. A wildcard alias can't be resolved directly, so it passes this check and is validated by Azure when the binding is created. A proxied alias — such as a Cloudflare "orange-cloud" record — is not visible to the check either; set it to DNS-only until the domain is bound and its certificate is issued.

{% hint style="warning" %}
CIPP no longer uses domain-verification TXT records. If an `asuid.<domain>` TXT record exists from a previous setup, **remove it** — the wizard flags it when the DNS check finds one, and a leftover record blocks Azure's validation even when the alias record is correct.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create hostname binding

The wizard creates the hostname binding on the App Service. Azure re-validates the DNS records as part of this step.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enable HTTPS certificate

The wizard provisions a free App Service Managed Certificate for the domain and enables the SNI SSL binding, which can take a minute or two. If the domain's alias is proxied through a CDN, temporarily set it to DNS-only while the certificate is issued and re-enable the proxy afterwards, since issuance validates the domain directly.

Wildcard domains are the exception: App Service Managed Certificates do not support them, so you will need to upload your own certificate and binding from the Azure Portal to secure a wildcard domain.
