# Mappings

Custom data mappings connect a source of information to a custom data attribute on a directory object, for one or more tenants. A mapping either populates the attribute automatically from CIPP's reporting database on a daily schedule, or exposes it as a field your technicians complete on the user forms.

You need at least one directory extension or schema extension before a mapping can be created, because the mapping needs somewhere to write the value.

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant                | The tenants the mapping applies to. All Tenants applies the mapping everywhere.                                                                               |
| Source Type           | Where the value comes from: Reporting DB for automatic synchronisation, or Manual Entry for a technician-completed field.                                     |
| Dataset               | For Reporting DB mappings, the cached dataset the value is read from. Shows N/A for Manual Entry mappings.                                                    |
| Sync Property         | The property within the dataset that is copied. For array datasets this lists the fields captured in each entry instead. Shows N/A for Manual Entry mappings. |
| Directory Object      | The directory object type the value is written to.                                                                                                            |
| Custom Data Attribute | The directory extension or schema extension property the value is written to.                                                                                 |

Adding or deleting a Reporting DB mapping re-registers the scheduled synchronisation tasks, so no further action is needed to start or stop the daily sync.
