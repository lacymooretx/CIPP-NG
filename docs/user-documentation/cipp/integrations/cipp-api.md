# CIPP-API & MCP

{% hint style="warning" %}
Self-hosted clients who originally deployed CIPP prior to v7.1, please see [#pre-version-7.1-self-hosted-deployments](cipp-api.md#pre-version-7.1-self-hosted-deployments "mention") for how to set up and configure your API for use before proceeding with this page.

If you're using a **hosted CIPP instance**, you can follow the instructions below to set up and manage your API clients with no additional steps.
{% endhint %}

## **Creating an API Client (App Registration)**

1. Navigate to CIPP > Integrations and click on CIPP-API.
2. Creating an API client:
   1. If you need to create an API Client
      1. Click on Actions > Create New Client.
      2. Fill out the form with the App Name.
   2. If you've already created an App Registration and would like to import it:
      1. Click on Actions > Add Existing Client.
      2. Select the API Client from the list.
   3. Ensure that you Enable the client in order to save it to the Function App authentication settings.
   4. Optionally set the [#custom-roles](../../../setup/setting-up-cipp/roles.md#custom-roles "mention") and Allowed IP Ranges for additional security.
   5. Select if you want MCP Access Allowed for this client. Enabling MCP Access sets this client up as an MCP connector app (the app your AI signs in as); CIPP automatically creates and manages a separate shared **CIPP-MCP** resource app that the tokens are issued for. You can enable MCP Access on more than one client, each with its own role and IP range. MCP Access is only supported on the latest CIPP infrastructure. See [#enable-the-mcp-feature](cipp-api.md#enable-the-mcp-feature "mention") for more information.
   6. Submit the form to create the client. Remember to copy the Application secret to a secure location.
3. Once you have the API Client(s) configured, click Actions > Save to Azure, this updates the Function App authentication settings with the new Client IDs.

{% hint style="info" %}
The IP Range list supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as standalone IP addresses or in CIDR Notation (for example 12.34.56.78/24 or 1.1.1.1).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Custom Roles will limit which API endpoints each API Client can access. This can be used to limit all API calls to read only for example.
{% endhint %}

## API Egress

{% hint style="info" %}
Visible to SuperAdmins only. The card is hidden entirely on instances where egress accounting isn't enabled, such as most self-hosted deployments.
{% endhint %}

At the top of the CIPP-API page, on hosted instances with egress accounting enabled, a card shows how much data your API clients have served today against the instance's daily cap, with a per-client trend you can switch between 24h, 3d and 7d windows. The API Client table below it also gets an **Egress Today** column with each client's own total for today.

## Using an API Client

After creating your first API client, the page will update to include additional information that is necessary for your automation:

- Token URL: This URL is what you will need when authenticating your automation to your CIPP instance. See [setup-and-authentication.md](../../../api-documentation/setup-and-authentication.md "mention") for more information.
- Tenant ID: This is the tenant ID for the tenant used to authenticate CIPP where your CIPP service account lives, this may take 5-15 minutes before it updates from when you create your first API client and press save.
- API URL: This will be the base URL required for all post-authenticated calls. Note that most automation tools will require you to append `/api` to this base URL for successful responses.

## **Disabling an API Client**

1. Navigate to CIPP > Integrations and click on CIPP-API.
2. Find the API client in the table and click on the 3 dots in the Actions column > Edit.
3. Flip the Enabled switch off and click Submit.
4. At the top of the page, go to Actions and click Save to Azure.

## **Rotating Secrets**

1. Navigate to CIPP > Integrations and click on CIPP-API.
2. Find the API client in the table and click on the 3 dots in the Actions column > Reset Application Secret.
3. Copy the new Secret to a secure location.

## **Troubleshooting**

- If you are getting permission errors when creating an API Client, check the CIPP-SAM application to ensure the permissions listed in the error are added and consented by an admin.
- If you have multiple CIPP-SAM apps, use the [#permissions-check](../settings/permissions.md#permissions-check "mention") to figure out which one you're using.

{% endhint %}

## CIPP MCP

The CIPP MCP allows you to add CIPP to any AI you use and immediately talk to it in natural language. For example, you can ask "List all tenants with unassigned licences" or "list all users for tenant MySpecialTenant.com". To set up the MCP, follow these instructions:

{% hint style="info" %}
**No client ID or secret needed.** CIPP publishes its OAuth details at a standard discovery address, so supported AI clients configure themselves from the MCP URL alone. Going forward, MCP is only supported on CIPP's latest infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### Enable the MCP Feature

In CIPP: **CIPP → Application Settings → Features** → turn on **MCP Server**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Create the MCP API Client

Open the [cipp-api.md](cipp-api.md "mention") page and **Create New Client** (or edit an existing one). Set:

| Field                  | Value                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Role**               | `Readonly` (recommended), or a custom read role. This becomes what the AI can do. The role must not carry its own IP restriction, for the same reason the client's IP range has to be `Any`. |
| **IP range**           | `Any`. The connector calls in from your AI provider's servers, so you can't pin it to your office IPs. |
| **Enable this client** | On                                                                                               |
| **MCP Access Allowed** | **On**                                                                                           |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Don't put IP restrictions on an MCP-enabled client.** MCP requests arrive from your AI provider's cloud IPs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft), not your network, so any allowed-IP range, whether on the client's own **IP range** or on the **role** you assign it, blocks the connector with a 403. Leave the IP range as `Any` and use a role that has no IP restriction. CIPP flags this on the API Clients page and in the client dialog if it detects it.
{% endhint %}

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Save to Azure

Click **Actions → Save to Azure**. This does all the Entra/Azure configuration for you automatically, including the callback URLs of the AI providers CIPP supports out of the box:

- **Claude** (`claude.ai` and `claude.com` for legacy purposes)
- **ChatGPT** connectors
- **Visual Studio Code** / GitHub Copilot Chat
- **Copilot Studio** and Microsoft 365 Copilot agents
- Local desktop and CLI clients, via a loopback callback

The instance restarts. Give it up to \~60 seconds before connecting. For AI providers CIPP doesn't list, and how the two-app model and Conditional Access work, see the collapsible sections after these steps.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Add the Connector in Your LLM

Add CIPP as a custom connector in your AI and give it the MCP URL. That's all you need: no client ID and no secret. The URL is `https://<your-cipp-api-url>/api/ExecMCP` and can be found on the API page.

Click **Connect**. You'll be redirected to your normal Microsoft / CIPP sign-in, so log in and approve. Your LLM completes the connection and CIPP's read tools appear.

If you have **more than one** MCP client enabled, add `?client=<client-id>` to the URL (for example `https://<your-cipp-api-url>/api/ExecMCP?client=<client-id>`) so the connector signs in as that specific client and gets its role and IP range. With a single MCP client the bare URL is fine. CIPP shows the exact per-client URL on the **MCP** tab of the CIPP-API integration.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Copilot Studio / Microsoft 365 Copilot agents are the exception.** They sign in as a confidential client with a secret, so follow [#copilot-studio-and-microsoft-365-copilot-agents](cipp-api.md#copilot-studio-and-microsoft-365-copilot-agents "mention") instead of this step. If your connection drops or the AI asks for a client ID, see the troubleshooting section below.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Verify

Ask your AI something like:

> _Using CIPP, list all my tenants._

If tools show up and return data, you're done.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

<details>

<summary>How MCP authentication works (two apps and Conditional Access)</summary>

**Two apps.** The API client you flag _MCP Access Allowed_ is the app the AI signs in as (the OAuth client); it carries the redirect URIs, and CIPP resolves each MCP session's role and IP restrictions from it. CIPP also creates and manages a single shared resource app, **CIPP-MCP**, which is the protected resource the token is issued for. Keeping the client and the resource separate is what lets your AI silently refresh its token in the background; if one app were both, Entra rejects the refresh (`AADSTS90009`, "requesting a token for itself") and the connection drops every \~60–90 minutes. It also gives MCP its own resource, separate from the app you use to sign in to the CIPP portal. You can flag more than one client for MCP, each with its own role and IP range.

**Conditional Access.** Entra evaluates CA "cloud apps" against the _resource_ a sign-in is for, so scope any MCP Conditional Access to the **CIPP-MCP** resource app. One policy covers every connector, whichever client it uses. Scoping CA to the client app does **not** govern MCP sign-ins. Avoid **device-compliance** or **named-location** controls on CIPP-MCP: MCP tokens come from the AI provider's cloud IPs on an unmanaged device, so those will block the connector (MFA is already satisfied at the interactive sign-in and carried in the refresh). Device-compliance CA on your portal-login app is unaffected, because MCP is a separate resource.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Add a callback for an AI provider CIPP doesn't list</summary>

Add the provider's callback URL to the **MCP client app** (the API client you flagged MCP Access), not the CIPP-MCP resource app. Easiest: on the **API Clients** page → **MCP** tab, each MCP client has its own section with its connector URL and two callback boxes. Add the URL to the box that matches how the client signs in, then **Save Redirect URIs**:

- **Mobile & desktop callbacks** (public / PKCE): clients that redeem the authorization code without a secret: Claude, ChatGPT, VS Code, and CLI / loopback clients. This is almost every AI.
- **Web callbacks** (confidential): only clients that sign in with a client secret: Copilot Studio / Microsoft 365 Copilot agents.

CIPP writes each box to the matching Entra platform and always keeps the built-in provider callbacks. A callback under the wrong platform fails at the end of sign-in: a secret-less client under Web returns `AADSTS7000218` / `AADSTS9002327`, and a secret-based client under Mobile & desktop returns `AADSTS700025`. **Allow public client flows** stays **Yes** (Save to Azure sets this).

In Azure instead: **Entra ID → App registrations →** your MCP client app **→ Authentication → Add a platform →** pick **Mobile and desktop applications** (public / PKCE) or **Web** (secret-based) → paste the callback → **Configure**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Troubleshooting the connection</summary>

**Asked to sign in again roughly every hour?** The AI needs the `offline_access` permission to receive a refresh token; current CIPP adds it automatically. After updating, disconnect and reconnect the connector once.

**AI asks for a client ID?** It doesn't support automatic registration. Enter the Application (Client) ID of the API client you flagged _MCP Access Allowed_ (the client, not the CIPP-MCP resource) and leave the secret blank.

**Every AI is a little different.** Check your provider's connector docs, or ask your AI directly: `Read the CIPP MCP setup instructions at https://docs.cipp.app/user-documentation/cipp/integrations/cipp-api#cipp-mcp and walk me through setting up the CIPP MCP integration. Give me the steps in order, the exact field values, the redirect/callback URL, and the ExecMCP endpoint URL.`

</details>

## Copilot Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot Agents

Copilot Studio (and Microsoft 365 Copilot agents) is the one supported client that **can't** use the automatic, no-client-ID/no-secret flow above. The Power Platform connector behind Copilot Studio signs in as a confidential client with a **client secret**, which Microsoft Entra requires you to wire up by hand. It signs in as the **MCP client app** (the API client you flagged MCP Access), and CIPP pre-registers the callback for you when you run **Save to Azure**. You just supply the client ID, secret, and scopes in Copilot Studio's wizard.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do the [#cipp-mcp](cipp-api.md#cipp-mcp "mention") steps first (Enable MCP → create the MCP client → **Save to Azure**). Keep the **MCP client's Application (Client) ID** and its **secret** handy. If you didn't save the secret, reset it with **Actions → Reset Application Secret**.
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### Add the MCP server in Copilot Studio

In your agent: **Tools → Add a tool → Model Context Protocol**. Set:

| Field                                | Value                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server name / description**        | Anything descriptive. The description drives whether the agent picks the tools, so write it like an API docstring. |
| **Streamable endpoint (Server URL)** | `https://<your-cipp-api-url>/api/ExecMCP`                                                                         |
| **Authentication**                   | **OAuth 2.0 → Manual**                                                                                            |

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Fill the Manual OAuth fields

| Field                 | Value                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client ID**         | The **MCP client's** Application (Client) ID (the API client flagged MCP Access).            |
| **Client secret**     | That client's **secret**, not blank. Copilot Studio is a confidential client.               |
| **Authorization URL** | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`           |
| **Token URL**         | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token`               |
| **Refresh URL**       | Same as the Token URL.                                                           |
| **Scopes**            | `https://<cipp-backend-host>/user_impersonation offline_access openid profile`  |

- `<tenant-id>` is your CIPP tenant ID (shown on the CIPP-API page).
- `<cipp-backend-host>` is CIPP's backend host: the `…azurewebsites.net` **Application ID URI** shown under **Expose an API** on the **CIPP-MCP** resource app registration. It's the host in the `scope=` of the sign-in challenge, **not** your vanity `cipp.app` domain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Keep `offline_access` in the Scopes field.** It's what makes Entra issue a refresh token; without it, Copilot Studio re-prompts users to sign in roughly every hour. When you enable MCP on the client, CIPP admin-consents `offline_access` on the MCP client app and pre-authorises the client on the **CIPP-MCP** resource app's `user_impersonation` scope, so a refresh token is issued and no consent prompt appears, even in tenants that disable user consent to applications. You don't need to grant consent by hand.
{% endhint %}

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Save, then close the redirect loop

Click **Create / Save**. Copilot Studio generates a **Redirect / callback URL**.

- If it's `https://global.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect`, CIPP already registered it on the MCP client app during Save to Azure, so there is nothing to do.
- If Copilot Studio shows a different (per-connector) URL, add it on the **API Clients** page → **MCP** tab: in that client's section, paste it into the **Web callbacks** box and **Save Redirect URIs**. (In Azure instead: your MCP client app → **Authentication → Add a platform → Web** → paste it → **Configure / Save**.)

{% hint style="warning" %}
For Copilot Studio the callback goes on the **Web** platform, the opposite of the other AI clients (which use **Mobile and desktop applications**). A secret-based sign-in from a Mobile/desktop registration fails with `AADSTS700025`; a callback that was never added fails with `AADSTS50011`.
{% endhint %}

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Connect and test

Click **Next → Create a new connection**, sign in with your Microsoft account and approve, then **Add to agent**. Ask the agent something like _"Using CIPP, list all my tenants."_ If the tools return data, you're done.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the agent ignores the server, the usual cause is a weak **Server description**. The orchestrator uses it to decide whether to call the tools at all. See [#scoping-copilot-tool-imports](cipp-api.md#scoping-copilot-tool-imports "mention") for staying within Copilot's tool limit.
{% endhint %}

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Scoping Copilot Tool Imports

CIPP advertises a small, fixed set of core tools rather than its whole catalogue. Older versions advertised every read-only endpoint at once, which pushes a client with a tool cap, Microsoft Copilot among them, past what it can import. If your connector still imports a long list of tools, recreate it against the current MCP URL.

Nothing is lost by that. The full read-only catalogue stays reachable through the core tools: your AI searches the catalogue, reads the schema of the tool it wants, and runs it.

To scope a connector further, add a query string to the MCP URL. The query is not part of the OAuth resource, so one CIPP instance can back several connectors, each scoped differently, with no extra Entra setup.

| Parameter                     | Effect                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?tags=Identity,Exchange`     | Only tools in those top-level CIPP categories.                                  |
| `?tools=ListUsers,ListGroups` | An explicit allow list of tool names.                                           |
| `?first=70`                   | Caps the catalogue at the first 70 tools. `?limit=70` does the same.            |

{% hint style="warning" %}
A misspelt tag matches nothing, and the connector comes up advertising zero tools with no error in the client. If a connector suddenly has nothing to offer, check the category spelling first.
{% endhint %}

## Pre Version 7.1 Self-Hosted Deployments

#### Assign the “Contributor” Role to the Function App

If you're self-hosting and running your own Azure Function App, you'll need to grant it proper access:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Open the resource group hosting CIPP.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Select the **Function App** (not an offloaded app).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Navigate to **Access control (IAM)** > **+ Add** > **Add role assignment**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Click on Privileged administrator roles.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Choose:

* **Role:** Contributor
* **Assign access to:** User, group, or service principal
* **Select:** The CIPP Function App identity

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Contributor** role should allow the identity to create and manage all types of Azure resources but does not allow them to grant access to others.

In the **Select** field and type `cipp`. As you begin typing, the list of options will narrow, and you should see the Managed Identity for your Function App.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
