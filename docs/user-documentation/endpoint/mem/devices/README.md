# Devices

The Devices page lists the devices managed by Intune in the selected tenant, and is where most day-to-day device management is carried out. From here you can sync, rename, reboot, and locate devices, retrieve recovery keys and local admin passwords, run Defender scans, reset or wipe a device, add devices to groups, and remove devices from management. Which actions are available for a given device depends on its operating system.

## Page Actions

<details>

<summary>Sync DEP</summary>

The **Sync DEP** button above the table synchronises the tenant's Apple Device Enrolment Program tokens, bringing in newly purchased devices. The sync runs in the background and can take several minutes, and can only be started once every 15 minutes.

## Table Details

The properties returned are for the Graph resource type `managedDevice`. For more information on the properties please see the [Graph documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/intune-devices-manageddevice?view=graph-rest-beta).

## Table Actions

Selecting a row opens a flyout showing the device name and its assigned user, from which the same actions are available.
