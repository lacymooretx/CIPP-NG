# Configuration Policies

Lists the configuration policies on the selected tenant, showing what type each policy is and who it is assigned to. Selecting a row opens a flyout with the policy's settings, which is useful for reviewing a policy in detail or copying its configuration into another system or script.

{% hint style="info" %}
The flyout for a Settings Catalog or Administrative Templates policy fetches the policy's settings along with Microsoft's own descriptions for each one, so the settings read as names rather than identifiers. This takes a moment to load, and other policy types show their stored details without the extra lookup.
