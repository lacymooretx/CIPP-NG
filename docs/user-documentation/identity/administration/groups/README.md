# Groups

The Groups page lists every group in the tenant and is where group membership, mail behaviour and lifecycle are managed. It covers the same ground as [Microsoft 365 admin center > Active teams and groups](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/groups), and extends it with actions that would otherwise need Exchange Online PowerShell.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Show Members</summary>

Adds a column listing the members of each group. You may need to select the column from the table's column selector as well.

Showing members and showing owners are mutually exclusive, because Graph accepts only one expansion per request, so turning one on turns the other off. Both buttons are hidden while the table is showing cached data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Show Owners</summary>

Adds a column listing the owners of each group, under the same one-at-a-time restriction as Show Members.

| Mail Enabled                 | Whether the group can receive email.                                                                                                          |
| Mail Nickname                | The alias the group's address is built from.                                                                                                  |

| Assigned Licenses            | Licences assigned to the group for group-based licensing.                                                                                     |
| License Processing State     | How far Entra has got with applying group-based licences to the members.                                                                      |
| Visibility                   | Whether the group is public or private.                                                                                                       |
| On Premises Sam Account Name | The account name the group carries when it is synchronised from on-premises Active Directory.                                                 |
| Membership Rule              | The rule that decides membership, for a dynamic group.                                                                                        |
| On Premises Sync Enabled     | Whether the group is synchronised from on-premises Active Directory.                                                                          |

Showing members or owners adds a further column listing them. In cached mode a **Cache Timestamp** column records when the cache was last refreshed, and a **Tenant** column is added when the tenant selector is set to All Tenants.

{% hint style="info" %}
Group Type is composed by CIPP rather than returned by Graph, which reports the same information across the `groupTypes`, `mailEnabled` and `securityEnabled` properties. A group is Microsoft 365 when its `groupTypes` include `Unified`, Mail-Enabled Security when it is both mail and security enabled, Security when it is security enabled alone, and a Distribution List when it is mail enabled alone. This matters when comparing against Graph output or the Entra portal, where no single equivalent field exists.

{% hint style="info" %}
A group has to be at least fifteen minutes old before **Create Team from Group** will work, as Microsoft needs the group to have finished provisioning first.
