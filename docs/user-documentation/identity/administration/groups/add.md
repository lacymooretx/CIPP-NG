# Add Group

This page creates a new group in the selected tenant. Complete the shared details, choose a group type, then fill in any additional settings that appear for that type. Selecting **Submit** creates the group immediately, with no confirmation step.

{% hint style="info" %}
Security groups and Azure role groups are not mail-enabled, so **Username** and **Primary Domain name** are not used for those types. A random mail nickname is generated instead. Any characters other than letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores are stripped from the username before it becomes the mail nickname.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
An example membership rule for a dynamic group, excluding guests and external users:

`(user.userPrincipalName -notContains "#EXT#@") -and (user.userType -ne "Guest")`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Members entered on this page are ignored for a **Dynamic Group**, because membership is calculated from the rule rather than assigned directly. Owners are still applied.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Group-based licensing requires the tenant to be licensed for Entra ID P1 or higher. Assigning licences through a group without the appropriate licensing is not compliant with Microsoft's licensing terms.
