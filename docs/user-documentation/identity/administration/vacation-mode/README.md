# Vacation Mode

Vacation Mode schedules temporary changes to a user's access and mailbox for a fixed period, then reverses them automatically when the period ends. It covers Conditional Access exclusions, mailbox delegation, mail forwarding and out of office replies, so a single schedule can cover everything that needs to change while someone is away.

Each vacation produces a pair of scheduled tasks for every change: one that applies it at the start date and one that reverses it at the end date. This page lists those tasks.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Cancelling is per task, not per vacation. Cancelling the task that reverses a change leaves that change in place permanently: an excluded user stays excluded, a delegate keeps their access, forwarding keeps forwarding. To call off a vacation that has already started, cancel the reversal only if you intend the change to be permanent, and otherwise let it run or undo the change by hand.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Because a vacation is several independent tasks rather than one object, use the **Reference** column to find every task belonging to the same schedule before cancelling anything.
