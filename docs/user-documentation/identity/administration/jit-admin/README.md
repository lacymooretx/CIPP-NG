# JIT Admin

JIT Admin creates administrative accounts that expire on their own, so temporary elevation does not turn into a permanent standing privilege. Each account is created with a chosen set of roles and an expiry, and CIPP removes the roles or disables the account when the window closes. This page lists the accounts CIPP is tracking, whether they are currently active, and what they were created for.

| Jit Admin Enabled    | Whether the JIT elevation is currently in force.                                                 |

{% hint style="info" %}
The JIT columns are not standard Entra ID properties. CIPP records them on the user account when it sets up the elevation, and uses them to know which accounts to act on at expiry. An account elevated outside CIPP does not appear here.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Under All Tenants, the first time the list is opened CIPP queues a background job to collect the data from every tenant and reports that it is still loading, so come back after a few minutes. Single-tenant views are always queried live.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If your CIPP role has a [JIT Role Template](../jit-role-templates/README.md "mention") assigned, this list is filtered to JIT Admins whose roles fall entirely within that template. An account holding any role outside your allow-list is left off the list rather than shown with roles hidden.
{% endhint %}

## Table Actions

The row actions are the access and account controls from the [Users](../users/README.md) page that matter for a temporary admin account after it is created. Each is greyed out if your CIPP role lacks permission to edit users. **Create Temporary Access Pass** is pinned to the row, so a replacement pass can be issued without opening the menu.
