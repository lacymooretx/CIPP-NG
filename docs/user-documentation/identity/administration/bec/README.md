description: Every Business Email Compromise run, for every user and every tenant, in one place.

# Business Email Compromise

The Business Email Compromise page lists every [Compromise Remediation](case.md) run CIPP has kept, for every user in the selected tenant, or across all tenants when **All Tenants** is selected. Each run is a case. Use this page to start investigations, to go back to one after the fact, to pull the report or the evidence package for a run completed weeks ago, or to see which queued runs have finished.

Runs are never expired automatically. A run stays, with its results, until it is deleted here or from the user's run history.

## Action Buttons

### Start investigation

Select **Start investigation** and pick the users to investigate in **Users to investigate**. The panel's **Start investigation** button is greyed out until at least one user is picked.

* **One user** opens that user's case page and starts the run there, so you can watch it progress.
* **Several users** queues one run per user, as a single job tracked on the Queue page, and closes the panel once they are queued. The runs appear in the table as they finish.

Runs can also be queued with **Run BEC investigation** on the [Users](../users/README.md) page, or started by an alert.

### All runs and By user

The toggle next to **Start investigation** switches between two views of the same runs.

| View     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| All runs | One row per run.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| By user  | One row per user, sorted with the most serious first. **Level** is the worst level of any of the user's runs; the score, status and date come from the latest run. **View runs** lists every run for that user. |

| Run Count           | **By user** only. How many runs the user has.                                                                                                            |
| Score               | The threat score behind the level. The breakdown is on the run itself.                                                                                   |

| Case Id             | **All runs** only. The case ID. It appears on every logbook line the run, its containment and its exports produced, so the Logbook can be filtered to a single case. |

The details panel also shows the user's display name, when the run was requested, the error message for a failed run and, in **All runs**, **Incomplete Count**: the number of data sources that did not collect in full, for example because a licence was missing or a cap was reached. The case page shows which ones.

## Table Actions

In **All runs**, and on each row under **View runs**:

<table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="checkbox">Bulk Action Available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Open case</td><td>Opens the run on the <a href="case.md">Compromise Remediation</a> page, exactly as it was collected. A queued or running case shows its live progress, and a failed one its error. From there the PDF report, the JSON and the evidence package can be produced, and containment run, for that case.</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Download evidence (ZIP, with PDFs)</td><td>Renders both report PDFs in the browser, builds a fresh evidence package from the stored run around them and downloads it, without opening the case. Greyed out until the run has completed.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Delete run</td><td>Removes the run, its results and its evidence package permanently. The logbook entries stamped with the case ID are not removed.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>More Info</td><td>Opens the Extended Info flyout with the full details for the selected row.</td><td>false</td></tr></tbody></table>

In **By user**:

<table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="checkbox">Bulk Action Available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>View runs</td><td>Lists every run for the user, newest first, each with the actions above.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Open latest case</td><td>Opens the user's latest run on the <a href="case.md">Compromise Remediation</a> page.</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Download latest evidence (ZIP, with PDFs)</td><td>Downloads the evidence package for the user's latest run. Greyed out until that run has completed.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>More Info</td><td>Opens the Extended Info flyout with the full details for the selected row.</td><td>false</td></tr></tbody></table>

Everything a run holds is metadata: audit records, sign-ins, directory audits, message-trace headers, permissions, consents, rules and devices. No message body, attachment or file content is collected, stored or exported.
