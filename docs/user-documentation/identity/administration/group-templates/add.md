# Add Group Template

This page creates a group template, which records the settings for a group so the same group can be created again later, in one tenant or across many. Complete the shared details, choose a group type, then fill in any additional settings that appear for that type. Templates are applied from the deploy.md page.

## Template Details

These fields apply to every group type.

| Field        | Description                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display Name | The name the group is given when the template is applied. Required.  |
| Description  | The description the group is given when the template is applied.     |
| Username     | The mail nickname the group's email address is built from. Required. |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Username is the Microsoft 365 mail nickname, which has to be unique within a tenant. A template built from an existing group carries that group's nickname, so it needs overwriting before the template is used in the same tenant.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Username** and **Email Aliases** accept variables, so a single template can produce tenant-appropriate addresses. `%tenantfilter%` is replaced with the target tenant's domain when the template is applied, as in `postmaster@%tenantfilter%`.
{% endhint %}

## Group Type

Select one group type. The type determines which additional settings appear below the selector.

| Licenses (optional)                                 | Security Group                                 | Licences assigned to the group, so members inherit them through group-based licensing. Group-based licensing requires the tenant to be licensed for Entra ID P1 or higher. Assigning licences through a group without the appropriate licensing is not compliant with Microsoft's licensing terms. |
| Let people outside the organization email the group | Distribution List                              | Allows senders outside the organisation to email the group.

| Email Aliases                                       | Distribution List, Mail Enabled Security Group | Additional email addresses for the group, entered one per line. Added as secondary addresses alongside the primary address.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Hide this group from the Global Address List (GAL)  | Distribution List, Mail Enabled Security Group | Hides the group from address lists, so it does not appear when users browse or search for recipients.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
