# Inactive Users

This report lists accounts that have not signed in for six months or more, so licences sitting on dormant accounts can be found and reclaimed. Both interactive and non-interactive sign-ins are taken into account, and the most recent of the two decides whether an account counts as inactive.

{% hint style="info" %}
Accounts that have never signed in at all are included, since an account with no sign-in history has by definition not signed in during the period. Days Since Last Sign In is empty for those.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Disabled accounts and guests are left out. A disabled account is already handled, and guest activity is recorded differently, so including either would add noise to a list meant to drive licence reclamation.

| Number Of Assigned Licenses            | How many licences the account holds, which is the figure that turns this report into a reclamation list.                                                                                                                                                 |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Removing a licence from a dormant account starts a clock on the data attached to it. A mailbox left unlicensed stops receiving mail and is eventually removed, and OneDrive content follows its own retention schedule. Where the data still matters, convert the mailbox to shared or run the account through the offboarding-wizard.md rather than simply stripping the licence.
