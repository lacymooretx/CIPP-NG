# MFA Report

This report shows how every user in the tenant is protected by multifactor authentication, combining Entra's own registration report with per-user MFA state and Conditional Access coverage. It answers the question a single portal blade cannot: whether a given account would actually be challenged at sign-in, and by what.

{% hint style="info" %}
The registration and Conditional Access parts of this report need Microsoft Entra ID P1 or higher. Per-user MFA state is reported regardless, so an unlicensed tenant still produces a usable report with those columns empty.
{% endhint %}

## MFA Protection Criteria

A user is protected when at least one of the following applies. Reading the three together is the point of the report, because each covers a different set of sign-ins.

* **Per-User MFA** is set directly on the account, and challenges every sign-in regardless of conditions.
* **Covered by Security Defaults** protects the user through Microsoft's baseline settings, which enforce MFA when a sign-in is judged risky.
* **Covered by Conditional Access** protects the user through a policy, subject to whatever conditions that policy sets.

| No MFA methods registered           | Every account with nothing registered, including disabled and unlicensed ones.     |
| MFA methods registered              | Accounts with at least one method registered.                                      |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Covered By CA** reports that a policy targeting the user is enabled, not that the policy requires MFA under the conditions of a given sign-in. A policy scoped to specific applications leaves everything outside that scope unprotected, which is why the column distinguishes the two cases. Treat "Enforced - Specific Apps" as a prompt to check what the policy actually covers.
